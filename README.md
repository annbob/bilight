# bilight
An Android application that controls RGBW and RGBWW lightbulbs at the same time, without having to switch "Remotes" like in the original application. Only compatible with the Milight v6 protocol(!)

This is a work in progress, it's very likely I will expand on this app in the near future (or even hours).
